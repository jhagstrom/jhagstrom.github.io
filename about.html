                        <p>
                            I am an introverted, procrastinating overthinker who has a day job working in the tech industry.
                            I have a passion for personal development and coaching.
                        </p>
                        <p> 
                            A passion which led me to create this site where I offer coaching services and also blog about topics related to personal development, or anything that piques my interest really.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I live in Sweden, on the west coast, with my family. I mentioned I work in tech, I have for 25 years across a few different industries. The majority of my career has been spent in technical consulting.
                            I enjoy coding and designing software. Cybersecurity is also a passion.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Outside work I really enjoy cooking, reading, photography, and being curious and exploring life in general.
                            I am also a football fan and I volunteer as a coach for my son's football team.
                        </p>

                        <h3>The site</h3>
                        <p>
                            I want this site to be as clean as possible, avoiding ads and tracking. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I will do my best to avoid issuing cookies. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            That said, I will include affiliate links to Amazon for books that I like and recommend. I will also track incoming links to see how you are getting here and how many visits I get. You know, things that you are curious about. For this, I use Simple Analytics, which is a privacy-focused alternative to Google Analytics.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I will post my writing in English, for maximum reach. However, I am Swedish so please excuse any grammatical errors.

                        <p>
                            The topics I write about will vary, there are many things I think about and I thought why not share those thoughts, even if this is yet another blog among millions.
