                    <h1>Do you need help?</h1>
                    <p>Are you not progressing like you would like to? At work or in other areas of life? Does it make you feel frustrated right now?</p>
                    <p>Investing in coaching can help you help yourself make sense of where to go next, and what to do next. It did for me, being coached helped me put things in perspective that I hadn't before and that opened up completely new ways to me. Ways that were always there, and I should have been able to come up with them, but I needed a catalyst to challenge me into looking at the same old things from new angles.</p>
                    <p>My approach is to separate between performance coaching and developmental coaching, where performance coaching is a way to become more successful/efficient/productive at what you are currently doing, and developmental coaching is about making changes to life that will get you to another role/weight/level of happiness.</p>
                    <p>I offer remote coaching sessions in both types of tracks. The sessions are conducted via Google Meet, Microsoft Teams or Zoom, whichever suits you best. Being a native swedish speaker I am able to host sessions in either swedish or english, but that is as far as my language skills stretch.</p>
                    <p>Both types of sessions are 30 minutes each, and I charge 45 USD per session. But before accepting payments I think it is reasonable to meet a first time just to get a feel for whether the relationship can be a fruitful one. So feel free to book an available slot in my Calendly and we'll set up a first meeting.</p>
