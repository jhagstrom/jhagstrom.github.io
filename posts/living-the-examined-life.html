                        <h3>Living the examined life</h3>
                        <p>
                            I can’t say I’ve lived a very examined life up until recent years.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Growing up I had no real dream profession. Sure, I wanted to play professional football, but I never seriously committed to getting there. 
                            I don’t think I ever really believed I had what it took in terms of talent.
                            I basically ended up where I ended up due to chance and some talent, I can’t say that I had conviction or that I worked very hard. 
                            At least not from the start. Even as I started working harder, it was still quite unstructured. 
                            I didn’t think about career progression or promotions, I just went to work, delivered and took on the next opportunity. 
                            Fortunately the opportunities kept coming.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As it happens I came across some factoid saying that this or that CEO read 50 books a year, which sparked something in me. Fifty books in a year is less than one book per week! 
                            I have always enjoyed reading, but I had never tracked my reading like that, measuring number of books I read in a year.
                            So I accepted the challenge (that I imposed on myself, there was never any actual challenge), and picked up book after book, plowing through them. 
                            I can’t remember which book got me started, but I have a strong feeling it was Switch by Chip and Dan Heath.
                            I read Kahneman, Adam Grant, Dan Pink et cetera, et cetera. I read about behavioral economics, psychology, flow state, deliberate practice, you name it. If it had to do with how people think and function, and ideas about how to improve, there is a good chance that I have read it. And I am taking reading tips still!
